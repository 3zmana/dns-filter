# Chatroulette DNS Filter

Chatroulette DNS Filter is a domain blocking list to chatroulette services for Adguard Home.

I created this list to block Chatroulette's services, because even though in their design they don't seem to be harmful. There are paedophile networks that are dangerous for our children.

# Compatibility

This list was designed to work with Adguard Home but you can use it in Pi-hole, uBlock Origin, Adblock Plus, Adguard.

# Usage

To add my DNS block list to your Adguard Home server, just copy URL : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3zmana/dns-filter/main/chatroulette-hosts

And connect to your Adguard Home dashboard then follow **Filters > DNS blocklists > Add blocklist > Add a custom list** Type the name you want and paste URL.

# Request to add a domain

You can request the addition of a domain name belonging to a Chatroulette site in the Issues section : https://github.com/3zmana/dns-filter/issues
